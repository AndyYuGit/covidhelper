***Abstract***

During the fifth wave of covid-19 Hong Kong, citizens searched on the internet to get the latest information about the pandemic. However, plenty of information on the internet leaves citizens feeling chaotic. There is outdated news, news with uncertain sources and news not from Hong Kong between. Information from government is also complicated and opaque to receive.  Citizens are frustrated about wasting so much time in search engines when they only need some necessary data. This project is aimed to increase the convenience of getting information about the pandemic. 
There are four main objectives: To design a convenient and time-efficient process for user to get the necessary information by using the app; To design a chat bot for user to get extra information conveniently; To design a system which is easy to be maintained and updated for adapting possible coming covid-19 waves; To design a location recording-warning function by GPS for user convenience.
